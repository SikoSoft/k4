# K4

A free and open-source web form for generating K4 documents, for filing taxes within Sweden. This tool creates the proprietary .sru files which Skatteverket requires when submitting documents digitally.

This form needs to be submitted in tax declarations when you trade stock, foreign currency or cryptocurrency.

Visually, the form here presents very similar to the PDF and paper form provided by Skatteverket. However, by using this tool, you are able to generate and download .sru files.

No account is needed. No interaction with a back-end server. Everything is completely client-side with no network requests.

The application is provided in Swedish and English.

In addition to downloading .sru files, you can even import any K4 documents you have saved in .sru format for further modification or simply verification.

I am to keep this package up to date with the latest requirements expected from Skatteverket.

This year, I am happy to say that I filed my taxes for the previous year by using a file generated from this application. :)
